# SCENARIO WEEK - INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON AND JUPITER NOTEBOOKS

+++
## Aims of the remainder of this week
1. To accelerate your initial learning of **python** in readiness for *Computational Thinking*
2. To ensure you are able to access and use your **Azure-based Jupyter accounts**
3. To ensure you have correctly installed **python and Jupyter on your laptops** and know how to run and use these tools on your laptop
4. To introduce the **UCL ChangeMaker Study** we have instituted to help you practice and develop your python programming skills
5. To ensure you have activated your **Azure Study Pass** accounts - these may not be required before *Data Analytics II* but must be activated now due to soon-to-expire activation codes.

## Jupyter notebooks

- are similar to **Mathematica** notebooks
— composed of "cells" that can contain formatted text, code and the output from running code
- are created and used in **internet browsers**
— can run directly on your laptops or can be accessed from the **Cloud** on powerful servers capable of working on big data projects
- can run either **python** or **R** code 
— and many other languages
- like Mathematica can use them to generate **PDF reports** and are ideal for reporting on data analysis projects
